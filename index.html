    <h1>About Me!!</h1>
    <p>My name is Diego Mendez and I am currently an university student in Mexico. I was born and raised in Venezuela and I have also lived in Colombia. I have always had a passion for cooking and trying different styles of food from all around the world. My primary interests rely on videogames, mostly survival horror, and learning about technology.</p>

<section id="about-me" class="content-section">
    <p>I'm studying Data Science and Business Engineering student at ITAM. I like to work on projects that help me broaden my knowledge on different subjects about technology and the impact it may have on the world. I have mainly worked with Java, Python and SQL, although I would never decline a project because it is always an oportunity to learn something new. </p>
    <p>Along with my studies I am working in DiDi, a mobility company in Mexico as a Business Intelligence Intern and have gained experience in multiple data analytics projects for the company.</p>

  <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Video Games</li>
    <p>My favourite hobby without a doubt, sadly university and work dont leave me much free time. I'm a big fan of survival horror and have played every RE, Alien, and Outlast. Right now I'm finishin RE 4 remake and then I want to try Silent Hill 2.</p>
    <li>Cooking/Baking</li>
    <p>I always enjoy cooking desserts, specially when I have free time. Italian desserts are my favourite, but of course I can make a tres leches. I'm planning on hopefully starting a cooking blog soon.</p>
