<section id="about-me" class="content-section">
    <p>I'm studying Data Science and Business Engineering student at ITAM. I like to work on projects that help me broaden my knowledge on different subjects about technology and the impact it may have on the world. I have mainly worked with Java, Python and SQL, although I would never decline a project because it is always an oportunity to learn something new. </p>
    <p>Along with my studies I am working in DiDi, a mobility company in Mexico as a Business Intelligence Intern and have gained experience in multiple data analytics projects for the company.</p>
